  It is the version the world sees. You can use the provided static generated site, or replace it with your own. As long as you are able to read content from an API.

## Concept
The public site is classified as *optional*. This service can be easily replaced by a custom application.

## Default Layout

[Public Site Grid]({{< relref "./public site grid/_index.md" >}}) is a simplistic default layout, working out of the box on every modern browser.

## Build your own public site

You can build your own site, either using a static generator, a Wordpress plugin, an SPA, or ...

All you need is the ability to fetch content from the [Public API]({{< relref "../albums manager/_index.md#public-api" >}}).
